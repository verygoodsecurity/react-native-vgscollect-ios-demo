## VGS Collect iOS SDK - React Native Demo

> **_NOTE:_** VGS does not support React Native. This examples shows how easily you can integrate <a href="https://github.com/verygoodsecurity/vgs-collect-ios">VGS Collect iOS SDK</a> into your React Native application and secure sensitive data with us.


## How to run it?

### Requirements

- Installed latest <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12" target="_blank">Xcode</a>
- Installed <a href="https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#installation" target="_blank">CocoaPods</a>
- Organization with <a href="https://www.verygoodsecurity.com/">VGS</a>


#### Step 1

Go to your <a href="https://dashboard.verygoodsecurity.com/" target="_blank">VGS organization</a> and establish <a href="https://www.verygoodsecurity.com/docs/getting-started/quick-integration#securing-inbound-connection" target="_blank">Inbound connection</a>. 

#### Step 2

Clone the application repository.

#### Step 3

Install npm:

`npm install`

Open Terminal and change working directory to `ios` folder that is inside:

`cd ~/react-native-vgscollect-ios-demo/ios`

Install pods:

`pod install`

#### Step 4

In `react-native-vgscollect-ios-demo` folder find and open `AwesomeProject.xcworkspace` file.
In the app go to `VGSManager.swift` file, find the line:

`let vaultId = "vaultId"`

and replace `vaultId` with your organization
 <a href="https://www.verygoodsecurity.com/docs/terminology/nomenclature#vault" target="_blank">vault id</a>. 
 
### Step 5 

Run the application and submit the form. 
Then go to the Logs tab on <a href="http://dashboard.verygoodsecurity.com" target="_blank">Dashboard</a>, find request and secure a payload. 
Instruction for this step you can find <a href="https://www.verygoodsecurity.com/docs/getting-started/quick-integration#securing-inbound-connection" target="_blank">here</a>.


## How it works?

The application provides you an example of how to integrate VGSCollect Swift framework into React Native via bridges. It displays native VGSTextFields forms that are included in React Native application.
It also shows you an example of how to integrate with CardIO and collect card data securely.

## What's inside?

- **App.js** - the main file that builds UI in React Native

Inside **ios** folder you can find classes that work as bridges between Swift SDK and React Native code

- **VGSManager** class that responsible for observing field states, submit data, working with CardIO. It imports VGSCollectSDK and configures VGSCollect instance and environment.

- **VGSManagerBridge** exports *VGSManager* module into React Native. Functions that can be used in React Native are declared by *RCT_EXTERN_METHOD* macros.

- **VGSCardTextFieldManager** class that works as wrapper on native VGSCollect UI elements. All Textfield are initialized and configured there.

- **VGSTextFieldManager** exports *VGSTextfields* declared in *VGSCardTextFieldManager* into React Native code.

- **AwesomeProject-Bridging-Header.h** bridging header used to make available Objective C classes in Swift classes.
